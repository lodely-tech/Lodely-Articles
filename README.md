A list of helpful guides and resources for your software engineering journey.

## Get Best Paying Software Engineering Jobs | Ultimate Guide
This is a - work in progress - ultimate guide on how to get software engineering jobs with maximum pay. Coming to you from someone who broke into tech right after being rejected by every university I applied to. If I did it, so can you.

In this guide, I explain how compensation for engineers work. How they are typically structured. And what to do to maximize all the factors in your favor. Things like specialization, market dynamics, talent density based on location, and company choice.

I also talk about the secret Silicon Valley Wealth Machine. Where engineers end up with compensation packages totaling millions and even occasionally tens of millions.
